Experience:
	To add more experience relevant skills:
		Make mouse hold experience by default and have it unload in the power area.
		This could also be a way to transfer power from and to the meters!

We could add roguelite elements:
Allow after each round to select random new upgrades, add more to default strength on every run.
Or when selecting an upgrade node - specialize and replace other upgrade nodes

Upgrade Tree with a central power/resource generator.
Power is constant - e.g. it produces 10 - you can spend it


Mouse Hold areas can be established to replenish parts like ammo, health regeneration, etc.

Trade-Offs:

Shotgun: Bigger area but less attack damage
Sniper: Smaller area but more attack damage
Minigun: Medium Area but more attack speed

Upgrades:

Conversion
Every enemy drops 1 red
100 red = 1 blue
100 blue = 1 green
Or sources like bullets
